### Repo Setup

Implement the entire TODO list from "roadmaps/plan_setup.txt" in this GitHub repository. This is a one-shot implementation requestâ€”create all specified directories, files, and configurations automatically where possible, including the full directory structure, CMakeLists.txt with C11 flags and multi-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android via NDK), integration of MergeSource files from "00_c_source_files" without external deps, Unity and CMock for unit testing with CTest and coverage, clang-format, cppcheck, and clang-tidy for linting with pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD across platforms, README.md with instructions and badges, copilot-instructions.md with the exact rules provided (clear, maintainable, optimized, multi-platform C11 code using only MergeSource), .gitignore, LICENSE (MIT), CHANGELOG.md, and any scripts or configs. Ensure everything is self-contained, extensible, and follows best practices for a C11 multi-platform template repo. If any step requires manual intervention (e.g., downloading tools), note it in a new file "roadmaps/remaining_steps.txt". Confirm completion by updating "roadmaps/plan_setup.txt" with checkmarks on done items.
