Manual steps required to complete setup:

1) Unity test framework:
   - By default, tests auto-fetch the official Unity sources during CMake configure (USE_OFFICIAL_UNITY=ON).
   - If you prefer vendoring, replace placeholders in tests/unity/ with unity.c, unity.h, unity_internals.h from https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity.

2) CMock (optional):
   - If using CMock for mock generation, install Ruby and the CMock gem, and use scripts/test/generate_mocks.sh with your headers.

3) Tools installation on developer machines:
   - clang-format, clang-tidy, cppcheck
   - lcov/genhtml (for coverage on Linux)
   - pre-commit (pipx or pip) and run: pre-commit install
   - Android NDK for Android builds; set ANDROID_NDK or ANDROID_NDK_HOME
   - On Windows, consider installing OpenCppCoverage if Windows coverage is desired

4) Doxygen:
   - Create docs/Doxyfile and configure PROJECT_NAME, INPUT, OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
   - Update scripts/docs/generate_api.sh to call doxygen

5) Quality tools :
   - Install lizard, cloc, include-what-you-use, graphviz, jscpd or equivalents
   - Update scripts in scripts/quality/ to call installed tools

6) Windows coverage :
   - Configure coverage tools on Windows (e.g., OpenCppCoverage) and wire into scripts/test/coverage.sh or a Windows-specific script
   - Update CI to upload Windows coverage if configured
