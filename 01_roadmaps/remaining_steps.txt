Manual steps required to complete setup:

1) Unity test framework:
   - Replace placeholders in tests/unity/ with official files from https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity
     - unity.c, unity.h, unity_internals.h

2) CMock (optional):
   - If using CMock for mock generation, integrate ThrowTheSwitch/CMock and add generation scripts.

3) Tools installation on developer machines:
   - clang-format, clang-tidy, cppcheck
   - lcov/genhtml (for coverage on Linux)
   - pre-commit (pipx or pip) and run: pre-commit install
   - Android NDK for Android builds; set ANDROID_NDK or ANDROID_NDK_HOME
   - On Windows, consider installing OpenCppCoverage if Windows coverage is desired

4) Doxygen:
   - Create docs/Doxyfile and configure PROJECT_NAME, INPUT, OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
   - Update scripts/docs/generate_api.sh to call doxygen

5) Quality tools (optional):
   - Install lizard, cloc, include-what-you-use, graphviz, jscpd or equivalents
   - Update scripts in scripts/quality/ to call installed tools

6) Windows coverage (optional):
   - Configure coverage tools on Windows (e.g., OpenCppCoverage) and wire into scripts/test/coverage.sh or a Windows-specific script
   - Update CI to upload Windows coverage if configured

7) Android emulator tests (optional):
   - Add emulator setup steps in .github/workflows/android.yml
   - Build an instrumented or host-based test runner that can run on the emulator if needed
   - Keep tests deterministic; avoid flakiness due to emulator timing
